## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the automation tests for the Salesforce Extensions for VS Code.

### WDIO VSCode Service

This project is based on `WDIO VSCode Service, available at https://github.com/webdriverio-community/wdio-vscode-service

### Getting Started

If you are interested in contributing, please take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

After cloning this repo, you will also need to clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode. The default topography is for `salesforcedx-vscode` and `salesforcedx-vscode-automation-tests` to reside side-by-side in the same parent location.

To install the dependencies, run `npm install`. You do not need to compile - when running the e2e automation tests the code is dynamically compiled.

For the VSCode extension (`{location}/salesforcedx-vscode`), you will need to run `npm install` but you do not need to compile or perform any other steps.

After the dependencies have been installed, open the folder in Visual Studio Code, then debug using the `Debug All Automation Tests` configuration (or run using the `Run All Automation Tests` configuration).

### Environment Variables

The following is a list of environment variables that are used with this project. Each has a default value and are obtained using the [environmentSettings](test/environmentSettings.ts) class.

#### DEV_HUB_ALIAS_NAME

Default value: `vscodeOrg`

#### DEV_HUB_USER_NAME

Default value: `svcideebot@salesforce.com`

#### EXTENSION_PATH

Default value: `{cwd}/../../salesforcedx-vscode/packages`

The default folder structure is `{location}/salesforcedx-vscode` and `{location}/salesforcedx-vscode-automation-tests`, and if both repos are at the same location no changes are needed for `EXTENSION_PATH`. If your folder structure does not match this, EXTENSION_PATH will need to be set to the relative path to 'salesforcedx-vscode/packages' .

#### THROTTLE_FACTOR

Default value: 1

### Dev Hub

A requirement of this project is for a dev hub to have been enabled on the user's machine. The default dev hub name is "vscodeOrg" and the default username is "svcideebot@salesforce.com", though this can be configured with the `DEV_HUB_ALIAS_NAME` and `DEV_HUB_USER_NAME` environment variables.
